Networking involves the practice of connecting multiple computing devices together for the purpose of sharing resources, information, and services. It enables communication between devices like computers, servers, smartphones, and more.

### 2. **IP Address and Subnetting**

- **IP Address**: An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network. It can be either IPv4 (e.g., 192.168.1.1) or IPv6 (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

- **Subnetting**: Subnetting involves dividing an IP network into multiple sub-networks to improve performance and security. It helps in efficiently utilizing IP addresses.Subnetting is the process of dividing an IP network into sub-networks to improve performance and security. It involves creating smaller, more manageable network segments. Let's go through an example of subnetting an IPv4 address.
